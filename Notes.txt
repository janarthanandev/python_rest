To start django project 
django-admin startproject profiles_project . 

To create django app, we are going to use manage.py as we created from django profiles_project
python manage.py startapp profiles_api

To enable newly creted profile app in django we need to add that and 
rest_framework app in profile_project/settings.py under installed apps
'rest_framework',
'rest_framework.authtoken',
'profiles_api',

To start django go to terminal 
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
#here 8080 is port number which we going to run in browser

In models.py
 We going to inherit AbstractBaseUser,PermissionsMixin of auth.models to create custom user 
 and BaseUserManager to create Profile Manager 

In settings.py 
we going to tell django to look on UserProfile
 for authentication and user registration of our project

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'profiles_api.UserProfile'

Django manage database with the help of Migration file that stores all
of the steps required to modify the database match our django models.
so if we changed the models or updated the model we need to create a
migration file.

To create a migration file:
python manage.py makemigrations profiles_api

To run a migration in our project:
python manage.py makemigrations profiles_api
